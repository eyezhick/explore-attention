# explore-attention

Attention Mechanisms in AI — with theory, code, visualizations, and real-world examples.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository is an educational toolkit for anyone looking to understand how attention works in deep learning, especially in NLP and vision models. It explores various types of attention mechanisms—from the original attention in sequence models to self-attention in Transformers and beyond. Each module is designed to teach by doing, with clear explanations, annotated code, and step-by-step visualizations.

## 🧠 Understanding Attention

### What is Attention?

Attention is a mechanism that allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. Think of it like how humans pay attention to different words when reading a sentence or different parts of an image when looking at it.

### Why Attention?

1. **Long-Range Dependencies**: Traditional RNNs struggle with long sequences. Attention helps capture relationships between distant elements.
2. **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, attention can be computed in parallel, making it more efficient.
3. **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide insights into what the model is focusing on.

### The Math Behind Attention

The core of attention is the attention score computation:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Where:
- Q: Query matrix
- K: Key matrix
- V: Value matrix
- d_k: Dimension of the key vectors

## 🎯 Types of Attention

### 1. Basic Attention Mechanisms

#### Additive Attention (Bahdanau)
- Uses a feed-forward neural network to compute attention scores
- More computationally expensive but can be more powerful
- Implementation: [notebooks/01_foundations/01_basic_attention.ipynb](notebooks/01_foundations/01_basic_attention.ipynb)

#### Multiplicative Attention (Luong)
- Uses dot product between query and key vectors
- More computationally efficient
- Implementation: [notebooks/01_foundations/02_multiplicative_attention.ipynb](notebooks/01_foundations/02_multiplicative_attention.ipynb)

### 2. Self-Attention

Self-attention allows each position to attend to all positions in the sequence:

\[
\text{SelfAttention}(X) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{XW_Q(XW_K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)XW_V
\]

Implementation: [notebooks/02_types/01_self_attention.ipynb](notebooks/02_types/01_self_attention.ipynb)

### 3. Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces:

\[
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
\]

where each head is computed as:

\[
head_i = \text{Attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)
\]

Implementation: [notebooks/02_types/02_multi_head_attention.ipynb](notebooks/02_types/02_multi_head_attention.ipynb)

### 4. Cross-Attention

Cross-attention allows one sequence to attend to another sequence:

\[
\text{CrossAttention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Implementation: [notebooks/02_types/03_cross_attention.ipynb](notebooks/02_types/03_cross_attention.ipynb)

### 2. Image Recognition

Vision Transformers (ViT) use attention to process images:

### 3. Audio Processing
