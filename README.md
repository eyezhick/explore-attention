# explore-attention

Attention Mechanisms in AI — with theory, code, visualizations, and real-world examples.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository is an educational toolkit for anyone looking to understand how attention works in deep learning, especially in NLP and vision models. It explores various types of attention mechanisms—from the original attention in sequence models to self-attention in Transformers and beyond. Each module is designed to teach by doing, with clear explanations, annotated code, and step-by-step visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Jupyter Notebook
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/explore-attention.git
cd explore-attention

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
